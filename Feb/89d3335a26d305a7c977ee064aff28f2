I wonder if anyone has run the numbers of those to be vaccinated. How many medical frontline workers are there, how many politicians (assuming the ANC is in the queue), how many prisoners, how many elderly at risk, and how many others? And, even more important: how many vaccinations can reasonably be done per week — by whom and where? I’m 81 and wondering when the government will manage to vaccinate me.
