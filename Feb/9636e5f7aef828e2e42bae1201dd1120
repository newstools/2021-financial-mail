Want to inspire "tax morality" in SA (Cover Story, January 21-27)? Start those lifestyle audits recommended by judge Dennis Davis on people doing business with the state. Upwards of 40% of public money is expended through tenders. On the other side of many of these transactions are vast patronage networks. What offends honest, hardworking people more than tax dodgers with Ferraris are tax dodgers who bought their Ferraris with profits from irregular state contracts. Life-changing riches have been made from deals that have returned zero or negative value to taxpayers. If a company’s main business is to fleece the taxpayer, chances are it’s also fleecing the taxman. The National Treasury has the resources to identify tenderpreneurs who might not be paying their tax dues, including vendor lists and quarterly supply chain management reports. Focus on companies that earn more than R10m in annual revenues from transactions with the state. Zero in on the parties to contracts declared "irregular" by the auditor-general. If lifestyle audits are to be done, include the accounting officers who signed these contracts. If the SA Revenue Service can overcome the bonds between people who call each other comrade and commissar and go after tax-dodging tenderpreneurs, it will boost the social contract between the government and taxpayers.
