Given the dearth of honest and competent parliamentarians, the death of the affable Jackson Mthembu (Obituary, January 28-February 3) is a great loss to the ANC. He was good man who evidently abhorred the disgusting goings-on around him. But he always kept his cool and, in his inimitable way, tried to show the good side of his otherwise failed party. It’s no cliché to say Mthembu will be sadly missed on both sides of the house. In the case of the ANC, he can be aptly described as "the last man standing". Those left behind are already the fallen.
