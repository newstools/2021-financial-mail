Given the poor record of corporate governance in SA, pardon my scepticism at some commentators waxing lyrical about the new Political Party Funding Act (Editorials, January 28-February 3). I would suggest that we wait and see if the act has any teeth and, importantly, if anyone enforces it. The lofty ideals of SA’s "solid constitutional foundation" have fallen far short in their implementation, and I fear this legislation will fall into the same category. Signing an act into law is probably the easiest part of the process. Finding the right people with the will to enforce it is another matter altogether.
