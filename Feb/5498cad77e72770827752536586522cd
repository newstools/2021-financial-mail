Former president Jacob Zuma has mastered the art of political brinkmanship with his latest preposterous allegations suggesting corruption in our judiciary. These events are driving the country to the brink of disaster. As the rhetoric escalates, defiant leaders must be warned that the showdown will rip our hard-won democracy to shreds unless sanity prevails. There is a deadly and dangerous game going on in the corridors of power that nobody controls any more. It has been exceedingly difficult, over the past months, to discern the precise limits to Zuma’s willingness to escalate the crisis that he played a pivotal role in creating. We are witnessing a game of chicken. The "winner" in such a game is the player who demonstrates the most reckless, suicidal disregard for outcomes — or the player confident enough to guess when the opponent is bluffing. History has proved that taking a conflict over the brink will result in unacceptable losses on both sides. The approaching political storm is growing in strength and sophistication, and becoming ominous. It has the potential to destabilise SA to the point of state failure.
