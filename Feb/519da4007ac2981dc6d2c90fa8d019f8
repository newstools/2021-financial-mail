1. Advancing on Trump Former US president Donald Trump’s battle to evade a criminal probe into his business empire appears finally to have run out of road, reports The Economist. On Monday, the US Supreme Court rejected a request from his legal team to suspend the Manhattan district attorney’s 2019 subpoena of Mazars USA, Trump’s accountants. "The work continues," tweeted district attorney Cyrus Vance jnr, who last week hired a former federal prosecutor with experience investigating organised and white-collar crime. At issue is whether the Trump Organisation misled lenders and tax authorities about the value of its properties. That’s not all. In Atlanta, the Fulton county district attorney may bring criminal charges over Trump asking Georgia’s secretary of state to "find" him extra votes in the presidential election. 2. Art and the algorithm Streaming has been a godsend to many while cinemas remain shut, but film director Martin Scorsese believes the art form is being "devalued" by streaming platforms. Scorsese says their picks of what to watch based on algorithms of your viewing habits "treat the viewer as a consumer and nothing else". Media experts say algorithms alone can’t be blamed for people consuming lowbrow content over films that are deemed worthy. Others see it as a battle between the old and new gatekeepers of art and culture, reports the BBC. 3. Will jab passports help? The UK is weighing the pros and cons of issuing Covid-19 certificates to people, which could unlock mass events and play a role in opening the economy. The government is aware of concerns over exclusion, privacy and discrimination, and whether vaccine passports could reduce risk in certain settings. Israel last week said vaccinated people would be able to download a certificate enabling them to work out in gyms and attend cultural events.
