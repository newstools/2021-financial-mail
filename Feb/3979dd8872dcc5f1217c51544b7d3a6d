Surely Fred Khumalo is not serious when he tells us that police minister Bheki Cele was lauded for his no-nonsense approach to crime prevention (A Moveable Feast, February 4-10)? Cele likes to come across as the tough guy, but is totally ineffectual. Perhaps I could enlighten Khumalo on just a few instances. First, the taxi industry controls SA — the failed Durban bus rapid transit system is testament to this fact. Second, the construction mafia has crippled any private building enterprises. And let’s not forget the ongoing attacks on farmers and the harassment of private individuals by taxi drivers, who force them to board (as in press ganging them), as reported in The Witness newspaper. There’s also the ongoing problem of drunk, illegal and reckless drivers who act with impunity, as they are rarely caught — and if they are, bribes change hands. I will, however, agree with Khumalo on one point: Cele lacks diplomacy and talks to the citizens as if he is addressing a kindergarten class. He should be reminded that respect is earned.
