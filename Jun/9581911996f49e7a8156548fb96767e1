The month of June, which is dedicated to the heroism of our youth, got off to a bad start, with the Stats SA "Quarterly Labour Force Survey" revealing the extent of the jobs bloodbath in SA, particularly for young people. According to the survey, the official unemployment rate among the youth is at 46%. This is astonishing, given that the government has over time had a number of initiatives to curb youth unemployment. These have included the youth employment services, presidential youth employment initiative and the Gauteng government’s Tshepo 1 Million. The fundamental problem is that these initiatives are not streamlined and they don’t talk to each other. So huge amounts of money are being spent, with little to show for it. Until we streamline these programmes and ensure there’s synergy, we will never deal with youth unemployment. With the commemoration of the June 16 uprising, political party leaders will be crisscrossing SA, promising young people that jobs and opportunities will be created for them. We owe it to the generation of 1976 to deal with the ticking time bomb of youth unemployment. Enough promises and platitudes — we need tangible solutions.
