It is not acceptable that citizens of this country who pay their rates and taxes to the government for services are then asked to volunteer their time to fix what the government is either unable to do, or too lazy and incompetent to do. We have seen beach clean-ups, pothole repairs and crime prevention, among others, taken over by public initiatives. But the latest joke is the Msunduzi municipality in Pietermaritzburg asking for finance-savvy volunteers to help it with the disaster that is its billing system. The government workers must be laughing their heads off as they sit around eating, talking or playing on their phones and receiving full pay while gullible members of the public do their tasks. It’s no wonder this country is, quite simply, going down the toilet. Tony BallGillitts The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
