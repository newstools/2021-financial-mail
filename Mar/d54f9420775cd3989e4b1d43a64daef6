After reading the excellent article on Joburg’s lost hotels, including the Carlton (Life, March 4-10), I took a saunter down memory lane and remembered a visit to the famed Koffiehuis with my boyfriend. As youngsters with a limited budget, we carefully scrutinised the menu to see what we could afford and settled on burgers. The elegant waiter eyed us with well-honed instinct, clearly recognising we were not in the same financial situation as the other clients. "What mustard would you like with your burgers," he asked, "French, German or American?" I answered nervously: "German, please." The reply came back, smooth as silk. "I’m so sorry, we don’t have any German [mustard]." Embarrassed, we resolved not to return until we had the confidence to face the challenges of lunch at the Carlton.
