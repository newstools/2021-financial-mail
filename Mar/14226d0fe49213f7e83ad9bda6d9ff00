It is the norm in any media article for both parties mentioned to be given the opportunity to respond to comments. What has become glaringly obvious recently, however, is that government departments regularly, and conveniently, choose to ignore requests for comment, hoping that the problem will go away or be forgotten. I will not bore readers with the many examples of the government disrespecting taxpayers and citizens, but it has become the norm for the various departments to ignore requests for comment on issues that affect people. Yet government officials are quite adept at promoting themselves at the slightest opportunity, notably when offering condolences to families who have suffered a bereavement — something I find quite opportunistic and false. The government must think we are all very gullible. Tony BallGillitts The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
