Well, the chickens have come home to roost, and they’re laying eggs, too. Those empty promises of yesteryear by vote-seeking politicians are being remembered. Specifically, free education for all, promised by none other than former president Jacob Zuma. This could well be the undoing of the ANC. These are SA’s potential leaders and business leaders having their legs cut off. When your future gets snuffed out like this, I dare say a T-shirt and a sandwich will not retain your vote. We have already seen the effects of the service delivery and housing promises. Remember, ANC, if you want to dole out cookies, don’t rob the cookie jar. The jar is now empty.
