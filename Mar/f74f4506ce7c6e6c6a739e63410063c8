I refer to the edition of the FM March 4-10. From the front cover, are we now to assume that it is only Jews, Afrikaners, Englishmen and Indians who are corrupt? I have been reading the FM for 40 years and this racial stereotyping is reminiscent of the worst days of apartheid. I am disappointed, to say the least.
