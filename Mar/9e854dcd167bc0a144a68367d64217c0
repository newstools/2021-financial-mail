The coverage of Eskom issues in last week’s FM (Editorials and Fox, March 11-17) was most interesting. In trying to revive Eskom, André de Ruyter is dealing with a messy situation not of his making. The age-old cry of "racism" when accused of underperformance is typical and boringly inappropriate. Irrespective of the colour of your skin, job underperformance has nothing to do with racism. Obfuscation and side-stepping real issues are unacceptable and not in the interests of Eskom or long-suffering taxpayers. Staff and others accused of underperformance need to realistically evaluate themselves — shape up or ship out. Regrettably, the good old days when Eskom operated as a first-class entity are in the past. The instability/competence of management before De Ruyter’s appointment speaks for itself: 12 CEOs in 13 years. De Ruyter is competent and well qualified. Unequivocal support from the Eskom board is essential for him to do what is best for Eskom and its customers. David WincklerPlettenberg Bay The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
