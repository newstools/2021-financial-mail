Earn the bonus, or else UK company directors must justify dividend payments and face the threat of their bonuses being clawed back if they do not act in the interests of customers and employees, the government proposes. A long-awaited white paper is designed to prevent more controversial corporate collapses, reports The Times. The intention is to prevent a repeat of accounting and corporate governance scandals at firms such as Carillion and BHS.

The last of a long line There are thought to be just four Jews left in Iraq after the death last week of Thafer Elyahou, Baghdad’s last Jewish doctor. Elyahou was an orthopaedic surgeon in public hospitals and had kept his religious identity secret. Marcelle Yacoub, the community’s leader, died six months ago. Only Elyahou’s sister and three other elderly Jews remain. In the 1950s, the number of Jews had grown to 150,000. Thousands left in the 1970s and when Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003 only 100 remained; but their number gradually dwindled. 3.

The Sistine Chapel is a tome in three volumes, each 60cm tall and each weighing 12kg, composed of digitally perfect photographic recreations of Michelangelo’s masterpieces in the 15th-century chapel. "You can see the actual brushstrokes" of the depiction of God’s beard in The Creation of Adam, which adorns the ceiling, says a review in The Spectator. The mega-door stopper sells for £16,500 (about R336,500).
