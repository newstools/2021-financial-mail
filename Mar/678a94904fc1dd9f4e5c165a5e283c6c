In "Testing the Waters" (Africa & International, March 4-10), Lenin Ndebele quotes Topsy Sikalinda of the Zambia Revenue Authority as saying: "We have a lot of trucks that make a lot of noise and bring disorder [to Livingstone]; so we ... need to bring sanity," in reference to a proposed weight limit on trucks crossing Victoria Falls bridge. It is a fatuous argument: what about all the trucks that would take the Kazungula route and pass through Livingstone as well? The fact is, Livingstone needs a bypass from the Kazungula route, round to the Lusaka trunk road. This connects more with Sikalinda’s other argument — which does hold up — concerning the ability of the elderly bridge to withstand heavy loads. Furthermore, if the Kazungula route is truly to be competitive with the Beitbridge route, there will be a need for upgrades to facilities at Groblersbrug/Martin’s Drift on the main route north from Gauteng, through Botswana to Kazungula — including widening or replacing the bridge over the Limpopo.
