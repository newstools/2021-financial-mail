President Cyril Ramaphosa claims that there is "no money" for Covid-19 grants and other relief for desperate South Africans. Yet there is still lots of money to pay the full salary, every single month, of every politician, from the president to the cabinet, premiers, MECs, MPs, MPLs, mayors, executive and management council members and the lowliest local councillor. As well as every traditional leader, king, queen, state-owned entity board, quango and royal household. All of them. Every month, and paid in full. So where is all the money? R500bn plus? "The people shall govern" has been trashed, to become a meaningless slogan better placed on a placard next to the pig trough on Animal Farm.
