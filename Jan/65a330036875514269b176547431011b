With the inordinate delays in the expected court cases involving fraud, corruption, money laundering and the like, and the repeated postponements of cases involving leading political figures, one wonders whether there is deliberate political procrastination or if this is sheer incompetence on the part of the prosecuting authority. Obviously the prosecutors must have a strong and well-prepared case before proceeding, and that requires proper investigation by competent and committed people. On the one hand, there is the attempt by a former president not to live up to his statement that he is looking forward to his day in court. On the other, the latest "circus effort" involves the Zondo commission. The question arises as to whether the hearings at the commission are a prerequisite to proceeding with a process in court if all the evidence — or at least sufficient evidence — is available for a proper prosecution. If the delays are politically motivated then SA really is in a sorry state. VA VolkerPietermaritzburg The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
