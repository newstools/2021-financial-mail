A good week A good week for President Yoweri Museveni — less so for Uganda, now stuck in his vice-like grip for five more years. Not that anyone is surprised Museveni won a sixth presidential term. It’s hard to lose when you’ve put the kibosh on campaigning in opposition strongholds, shut down the internet, wielded the security apparatus like a blunt instrument, and held your political rival hostage. But this is the man who, on ascending to office in 1986, said: "The problem of Africa … is not the people, but leaders who overstay in power." Well, quite. A bad week The minister, the megaphone and megalomania: a cautionary tale. A photo-op turned into a PR disaster for Lindiwe Zulu last week. Ever a person of the people, the social development minister, from the comfort of a police Nyala, used a loudhailer to exhort elderly and disabled social grant applicants to maintain social distancing. When that failed, the police let rip with a water cannon. That there was such a lengthy queue in the first place was due to bungling by Zulu’s department. To then tell critics to "grow up" is simply hubris of the worst kind.
