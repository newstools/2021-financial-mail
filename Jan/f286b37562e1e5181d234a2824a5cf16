The US is no longer the land of the free and home of the brave. Under President Donald Trump it has become the land of the despot and home of the deranged. It is a country under siege, with fascist elements determined to maintain the status quo in a democracy gone berserk. Trump’s grip on power is slipping, even as he stubbornly refuses to concede defeat in the presidential election. Republicans do not want to believe Trump lost. As events escalate, the recklessness is striking — the willingness to tap into the darker currents and the complete disregard for the rule of law. The US president resembles a volatile, unpredictable leader, obsessed with his enemies — real and imagined — and callous in his disrespect for the US constitution. His bravado, hubris and lies will be his undoing. Trump is radically escalating his vicious campaign to discredit the election results. He is acutely aware that prison may await him if he loses. The litany of allegations against him since his defeat now have the capacity to break through the partisan firewall that has thus far insulated him. Should he continue to cling to power, the US will be on perilous ground. History will show that the events in Washington last week cost the US its moral high ground.
