1. Helping hands for Mozambique Rwanda has plans to deploy troops to help Mozambique fight an insurgency in its northern Cabo Delgado province that has left more than 2,900 people dead, Bloomberg reports. Mozambican president Filipe Nyusi visited Rwanda in April, at about the time a Southern African Development Community (Sadc) summit about the insurgency was postponed. Sadc, which doesn’t count Rwanda among its 16 member states, also plans to deploy its standby force to the region. Conflict in the country has halted investment. A consortium led by TotalEnergies recently stalled a $20bn natural gas project because of it. 2. Funds draw the line Norway’s largest pension fund, KLP, will no longer invest in 16 companies, including Alstom and Motorola, because of their links to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, Reuters reports. Along with a number of other countries, Norway considers the settlements a breach of international law. A 2020 UN report found that 112 companies have operations linked to the West Bank. The companies help facilitate Israel’s presence and therefore risk being complicit in breaches of international law, and KLP’s ethical guidelines, it said. The move follows a decision by Norway’s sovereign wealth fund in May to exclude two companies linked to construction and real estate in the Palestinian territories. 3. Pay up, oil firm tells US TC Energy Corp, the Canadian company behind the Keystone XL pipeline project, will seek more than $15bn in damages from the US government, which it has accused of violating free trade obligations when it revoked the permit for the project. US president Joe Biden pulled the plug on the project on his first day in the White House, ending more a decade of controversy and marking a win for environmentalists. The project would have carried oil from the tar sands of Canada to the US.
