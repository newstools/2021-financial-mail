Given the merry-go-round that exists in our government, together with the appointment of ineffectual candidates (inner-circle cadres), surely it is time to rethink the existence of "ministers" and maybe administer the last rites to this concept?

Most importantly, their positions would not be dependent on their friendships with ruling party bosses. Your article on the vaccine issues, "What’s Holding Up the Vaccine Rollout?" (Features, June 24-30), proves the benefit of dealing with people who are experts in their fields and are not out to score political points when they’re not grandstanding in fedoras or painting their nails during government meetings. Imagine the savings to the fiscus if this idea could be a reality? Tony BallGillitts The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
