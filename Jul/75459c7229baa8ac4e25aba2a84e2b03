It was refreshing to read the balanced article on the DA by Natasha Marrian (Cover Story, June 10-16). The DA may have scored some own goals, but at least it hasn’t stolen taxpayers’ money. It’s used that for the purpose it was intended: to benefit the people of SA. This is the message the party should send: where the DA governs on its own, everything works better. The result is greater competence, less corruption, fewer qualified municipal audits, better schooling, better health care, better roads and better infrastructure. I recently received my Covid vaccination in Somerset West in a clean, efficient hospital run by polite staff. I have had similar reports from those who have attended other vaccination sites in the Western Cape — unlike Charlotte Maxeke hospital in Gauteng, which remains closed, and many hospitals in ANC-controlled cities, where health care has broken down. We must stop complaining and actually do something positive. Like voting to get our country back. Paul McNaughtonStellenbosch The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
